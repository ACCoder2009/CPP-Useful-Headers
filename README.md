# Optimized-CPP
This repository stores some of my own version of useful C++ features that I make when learning C++. Every visitor can use them WITHOUT limits. Hope that they can also help you. I will update them to make sure they are easy to use and perform well.
Log.h, String.h and Array.h will be uploaded soon.
